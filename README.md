# task3

I’m happy to share my third task during the CodSoft internship, where I designed a menu for a Japanese restaurant! 🎌🍣

I focused on creating a simple and user-friendly design to make the ordering process easier. The app, Fasto Delivery App, displays different food categories, and upon selecting a category, it shows the restaurants offering those dishes. 

I worked to achieve a balance between an attractive look and ease of use by incorporating clear categorization and a design that reflects the spirit of Japanese cuisine. 🎨

I hope you like the design! 🌟
